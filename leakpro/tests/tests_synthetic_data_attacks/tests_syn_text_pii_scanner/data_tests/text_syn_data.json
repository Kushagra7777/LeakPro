        "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 12768/02) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Austrian national, Mr Bernhard Mok (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 May 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr L. Wei\u00df, a lawyer practising in Gf\u00f6hl. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs.\n\nOn 17 November 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings, the lack of remedies in that respect and the alleged breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Gf\u00f6hl.\n\n1. The administrative proceedings\n\nThe applicant owned a forest and a sawmill.\n\nOn 2 June 1986, upon a request lodged by the authorities, he was ordered to carry out roadworks.\n\nOn 24 March 1998 the Vorarlberg Regional Government (Landesregierung) ordered the applicant to carry out certain road and bridge works because, due to his failure to abide by the previous order, he was in breach of forest regulations.\n\nOn 17 September 1998 the applicant submitted to the Regional Government that no building permit or decision on a specific forest use existed for the planned road and bridge. Furthermore, he alleged that the Regional Government had failed to indicate the forest area to be cut or the amount of wood to be processed in the sawmill.\n\nOn 10 November 1998 the applicant withdrew his building request. On the same date the Regional Government imposed a fine of 2,500 Austrian Schillings (ATS) on him.\n\nOn 21 January 1999 the applicant lodged an objection against the decision.\n\nOn 28 June 1999 the Federal Minister for Agriculture and Forestry dismissed the applicant's objection.\n\nThe Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request for judicial review on 11 January 2000.\n\n2. The judicial proceedings\n\nOn 24 February 1999 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court. He complained, inter alia, about the non-existence of a system of constitutional review of administrative acts.\n\nOn 28 June 1999 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with his complaint since the decision under dispute was not a special enactment. However, the Constitutional Court remitted the case to the Administrative Court, finding that the Administrative Court had failed to examine the complaint that the Road Traffic Act did not meet the requirements of the Constitution as regards road building in forests (see paragraphs 22 to 24 below).\n\nOn 11 July 2000 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint. It found, inter alia, that despite the applicant's allegation, the enactment did not allow the arbitrary imposition of forestry works by the authorities since it was only applicable to persons whose business included forestry.\n\nIn the meantime, the Constitutional Court on 25 July 2000 had declined to deal with the applicant's complaint lodged on 26 June 1999. It found that the enactment complied with the provisions of the Federal Forest Act (Bundesforstgesetz 1969) and the Federal Forestry Ordinance (Bundesforstverordnung).\n\nThe decision was served on the applicant on 14 August 2000."

Sch\u00f6nborn, a lawyer practising in Erlangen. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his right to freedom of expression had been violated on account of a restraining order (Ausschlusshinweis) issued by a regional court preventing him from taking part in a public demonstration by a left-wing extremist organisation.\n\nOn 26 February 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention it was decided that, although the application was admissible, it was not necessary to pursue the case before the Court.\n\nWritten submissions (Rule 59 \u00a7 1) were received from European Union of Jewish Students, as third-party interveners, and from Mr Uwe Raschke (representative of NSU Watch).\n\nThe Court decides to take no further action in the present case in accordance with Article 31 of the Convention. It refers, in particular, to its decision of 3 April 2007 in the case of P\u00f6tschko v. Germany (no. 48235/06), where similar complaints under Article 10 of the Convention were considered and where it was also found that no further action was appropriate.\n\nIn the light of that decision, the Court requests the Registrar to remove the case from the list."
